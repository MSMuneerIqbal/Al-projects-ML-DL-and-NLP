# Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP Projects

This repository is a comprehensive collection of projects covering Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each project is organized into its own folder, containing all relevant files, code, and documentation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into folders for each project, with the following structure:

```
- Project-1
  - Code
  - Data
  - Documentation
- Project-2
  - Code
  - Data
  - Documentation
...
```

Each project folder includes:
- **Code**: All implementation files, scripts, or notebooks.
- **Data**: Datasets or links to external datasets used in the project.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations, usage instructions, and results.

## Project Descriptions

### 1. **Project Name: Example - Sentiment Analysis**
**Description**: This project demonstrates how to build a sentiment analysis model using NLP techniques to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.

- **Dependencies**:
  - `nltk`: Text preprocessing and sentiment analysis tools.
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning algorithms.
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and cleaning.

### 2. **Project Name: Image Classification with CNN**
**Description**: A deep learning project that implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into various categories.

- **Dependencies**:
  - `tensorflow`: Building and training the CNN.
  - `numpy`: Numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib`: Visualization of training results.

### 3. **Project Name: Predictive Modeling - House Price Prediction**
**Description**: A machine learning regression model to predict house prices based on features like location, size, and more.

- **Dependencies**:
  - `pandas`: Data preprocessing.
  - `numpy`: Feature scaling and transformations.
  - `scikit-learn`: Regression models and evaluation metrics.

### 4. **Project Name: Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
**Description**: An NLP task to identify entities like names, locations, and dates in text using state-of-the-art models.

- **Dependencies**:
  - `spacy`: Pre-trained models for NER.
  - `transformers`: Advanced language models like BERT.
